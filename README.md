Hi, I'm Wyatt and I've been learning to enjoy programming and using GitHub to keep track of projects I've got going on. Here you'll find mainly Python and R source code for projects I've been working (struggling) on. I also have a few guides coming down the pipeline including one on automating animal behaviour research. I (plan to) talk about those more at my website: https://wyatt-toure.github.io/
